A curated list of awesome data cube tools for Earth observation data.

Inspired by all of the other awesome lists in the GitHub-Universe.

## Data cube in one sentence

> A datacube is a massive multi-dimensional array, also called “raster data” or “gridded data”; “massive” entails that we talk about sizes significantly beyond the main memory resources of the server hardware. Data values, all of the same data type, sit at grid points as defined by the d axes of the ddimensional datacube. Coordinates along these axes allow addressing data values unambiguously.
